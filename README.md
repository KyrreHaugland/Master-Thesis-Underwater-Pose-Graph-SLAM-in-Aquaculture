# Master Thesis: Underwater Pose Graph SLAM for Future Aquaculture
Code used in my master thesis: "Underwater Pose Graph SLAM with DVL-Enhanced Visual Loop Closure for Future Autonomous Aquaculture"

The code is developed in python 3.7, MATLAB and C++. 
The python libraries used are listed as follows:
- GTSAM 4.1.0
- opencv-python 3.4.2.17
- opencv-contrib-python 3.4.2.17
- pandas 1.2.3
- scipy 1.6.2

The clahs.m MATLAB code is distributed by Ryan Eustice.
